### Questions 1:

SELECT companies.permalink,
       companies.founded_at_clean,
       acquisitions.acquired_at_cleaned,
       acquisitions.acquired_at_cleaned -
         companies.founded_at_clean::timestamp AS time_to_acquisition
  FROM tutorial.crunchbase_companies_clean_date companies
  JOIN tutorial.crunchbase_acquisitions_clean_date acquisitions
    ON acquisitions.company_permalink = companies.permalink
 WHERE founded_at_clean IS NOT NULL
 
 
 
 
 ### Questions 2: [Interval function]
 
 The interval is defined using plain-English terms like ‘10 seconds’ or ‘5 months’. Also note that adding or 
 subtracting a date column and an interval column results in another date column as in the above query.
 

 SELECT companies.permalink,
       companies.founded_at_clean,
       companies.founded_at_clean::timestamp +
         INTERVAL '1 week' AS plus_one_week
  FROM tutorial.crunchbase_companies_clean_date companies
 WHERE founded_at_clean IS NOT NULL
 
 
 
 ### Question 3: [Now function]
 
  SELECT companies.permalink,
       companies.founded_at_clean,
       NOW() - companies.founded_at_clean::timestamp AS founded_time_ago
  FROM tutorial.crunchbase_companies_clean_date companies
 WHERE founded_at_clean IS NOT NULL
 
 
 ### question 4 ###
 
 Write a query that counts the number of companies acquired within 3 years, 5 years, and 10 years of being 
 founded (in 3 separate columns). Include a column for total companies acquired as well. Group by category 
 and limit to only rows with a founding date.
 
 select companies.category_code,
 count (case when acquisitions.acquired_at_cleaned - companies.founded_at_clean::timestamp <= 
        interval '3 years' then 1 else NULL end) as count_3y,
 count (case when acquisitions.acquired_at_cleaned - companies.founded_at_clean::timestamp <= 
        interval '5 years'  then 1 else NULL end) as count_5y,
 count (case when acquisitions.acquired_at_cleaned - companies.founded_at_clean::timestamp <= 
        interval '10 years' then 1 else NULL end) as count_10y,
 count(*) as total_count

FROM tutorial.crunchbase_companies_clean_date  companies
JOIN tutorial.crunchbase_acquisitions_clean_date acquisitions
ON acquisitions.company_permalink = companies.permalink
WHERE founded_at_clean IS NOT NULL
group by 1
order by total_count ;
